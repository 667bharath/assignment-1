wriete Verilog code and test bench for following circuits

1)4-bit Sequence detector using FSM, using moore machine 
2)verilog code for 4-bit even bit parity encoder
3)3x3 bit multiplier constructed with 3 bit adders (build adder using functions) (ckt diagram in next slide)
4)Verilog code for assignment question on counters

There are 2 Counters, "Counter A" being asynchronous up counter & "Counter B" is an asynchronous down counter and at T=0, 0000 & 1111 are loaded respectively as shown. Clock source (CLK) available is 1MHz.
1. Complete the design such that Counter B decrements by one value each time when decimal "12" appears at output of Counter A (AO being LSB)?
2. What is the decimal value at outputs of both Counter A & Counter B at T=0.2 milli seconds?
3. What is the frequency of BO with respect to CLK (1MHz)?
