wriete Verilog code and test bench for following circuits

1)4-bit Sequence detector using FSM, using moore machine 
2)verilog code for 4-bit even bit parity encoder
3)3x3 bit multiplier constructed with 3 bit adders (build adder using functions) (ckt diagram in next slide)
4)Verilog code for assignment question on counters
